     If a class has an abstract method, the whole class must be declared abstract. Not all methods in an abstract class have to be abstract methods.
     An abstract class can have a mixture of abstract and non-abstract methods. Subclasses of an abstract class must implement (override) all abstract methods of its
     abstract superclass. The non-abstract methods of the superclass are just inherited as they are. They can also be overridden, if needed.*/
